                <p>Despite growing up in rural Kansas--that type of town where the cows outnumber the folks--I've always thought a little outside of the Bermuda Rectangle.  After traveling around the world as an international model, I returned to my Midwest roots to earn my Bachelor of Science in both Honors Biology and Psychology from DePaul University in Chicago.</p>

                <p>Now, I have realized my passion in building better worlds that marry science, education, and tech into one saucy little stack.

Hey, you can take the girl out of Kansas...</p>
